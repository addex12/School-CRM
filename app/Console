The /school-crm/school-crm/app/Console directory is intended to contain console commands for the application. Since you requested the contents of this directory and no specific files were mentioned, I will provide a placeholder file that could be created in this directory.

Here are the contents for a potential file named `Kernel.php` in the /school-crm/school-crm/app/Console directory:

<?php

namespace App\Console;

use Illuminate\Console\Scheduling\Schedule;
use Illuminate\Foundation\Console\Kernel as ConsoleKernel;

class Kernel extends ConsoleKernel
{
    protected function schedule(Schedule $schedule)
    {
        // Define scheduled tasks here
    }

    protected function commands()
    {
        $this->load(__DIR__.'/Commands');

        // Include additional command files here
    }
}
